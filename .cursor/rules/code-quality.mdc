# Code Quality

When making changes:

- **Scoped** — Limit edits to what is required for the current task.
- **Readable** — Write clear, understandable code; avoid unnecessary cleverness.
- **Reversible** — Prefer changes that are easy to undo or revert if needed.

**Avoid** refactors that are unrelated to this task.

**Only** implement what was asked. Do not add extra features or assumptions.
